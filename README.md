# Analyzing Ideological Outreach in Social Media Networks: Numerical Methods Project

This repository contains a Numerical Methods project focused on analyzing the dynamics and patterns of ideological outreach in diverse social media networks. The project utilized numerical methods and network modeling to develop a simulation model for this analysis.

## Project Highlights

### Numerical Simulation Model Development
- Devised and implemented a bespoke mathematical model and algorithm.
- Aimed at understanding ideological dissemination across social media networks.
- Utilized numerical methods and network modeling techniques.

### Course Context
This project was undertaken as part of the MA203: Numerical Methods course in the 3rd semester at the Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar. It was completed collaboratively with four other team members, contributing to the coursework and practical application of numerical methods in understanding social network dynamics.
